        <h2>Explore the RTS genre (Real-time strategy)</h2>
        <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns. Real-time strategy games allow for all players to simultaneously play the game in "real-time".
          <br>
          In a real-time strategy game, the participants position structures and maneuver units under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game.

        <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress incrementally in turns. Real-time strategy games allow for all players to simultaneously play the game in "real-time". This is contrasted by turn-based strategy (TBS) games, where players must take turns to play. The term "real-time strategy" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s.
